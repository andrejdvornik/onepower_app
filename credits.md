### The Fellowship Behind the Power

No spectrum is computed alone.

This Explorer stands upon the shoulders of a noble fellowship:

---

### 🧙 The Architects

The **OnePower** framework, forged in the fires of halo model formalism, provides the engine that shapes matter, galaxies, and haloes across the Universe. Without the work of Maria Cristina Fortuna, Marika Asgari and Andrej Dvornik, the **OnePower** would not exist.

---

### 🔭 The Cosmologists of Old

With gratitude to the many works that guide modern large-scale structure modelling:

* Tinker et al.
* Sheth & Tormen
* Navarro, Frenk & White
* Mead et al.
* Zheng et al.
* Cacciato et al.
* and many many others

Their equations echo still through every slider adjustment.

### 🛠️ The Tools of the Realm

* Python, wielder of scientific spells
* NumPy, keeper of arrays
* Plotly, renderer of interactive visions
* Streamlit, builder of this web-based gateway

Without them, this realm would be but an empty void.

### 👥 The Users, The True Fellowship

To those who:

* Slide $\Omega_{\mathrm{c}}$ by 0.01 “just to see”
* Zoom into the 1-halo regime
* Compare rival cosmologies in ratio plots
* Save models like collecting Rings of Power

You are the true explorers of parameter space.
